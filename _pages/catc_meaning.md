title: What Does This Mean for the Public Service?
---
-----------------------------------------------------------------
It means working in new ways where we have the flexibility to make decisions and move forward without perfect understanding. We focus on user needs over business requirements and we value a learning organization over a planning organization. We share common platforms - such as identity and payments - building-once and using-many. We unleash the potential in data to solve our toughest challenges.

To do this, an all-of-government approach is needed, which means: 

* A renewed citizen-centric focus
* Collaboration and co-creation with community and industry
* A transition to digital services where it makes sense
* Updates to governance, processes and procurement
* A review of existing policy and law to reduce red tape
* Getting deeper insights from data
* Improving back office efficiencies
* Ensuring the workforce remains enabled
