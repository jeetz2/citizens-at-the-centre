title: How Was Citizens @ the Centre Developed?
---
---------------------------------------------------------------
In 2015, groups across government connected to share stories, strategies and priorities regarding government’s future vision for service delivery, and to ensure that we continue to put Citizens @ the Centre. From across our ministries, strategic planners, senior executive, program leads, operational staff and technology experts met and observed that a shared but uncoordinated transformation is underway. Through facilitated sessions, engagement, deliberation and analysis, they reflected on their individual ministries’ directions, strategies and priorities, and discussed ways in which they can work towards shared outcomes. Further, insights on emerging digital trends were gleaned from industry experts such as Gartner, Forrester, Accenture, Deloitte, and we collaborated with our government peers at the federal, state and municipal levels around the world. This laid out the foundation for a refreshed Citizens @ the Centre.
