Citizens @ the Centre (LINK TBD) was first published in 2010. At that time, the Ipad didn’t exist and app stores were just emerging. Since then, considerable government data has been made open through DataBC, Government’s front door “Gov2.0” made government easier to navigate, citizen engagement on important issues was increased, more than 16 call centres were consolidated and improved, and more than 3-million BC Service Cards were put in the hands of British Columbians. Internally, through initiatives such as Leading Workplace Strategies, we now work in flexible new ways, our workforce embraces new digital tools in the office and in the field, over 400 datasets including things such as road conditions and community health are open for entrepreneurs and researchers to innovate and co-create.

Today, British Columbians are online and comfortable using digital products and services, with 94% having access to high-speed internet. So, just like the quality interactions they get in their daily lives with their banks, retailers, and communities, they have high expectations for services they receive from government. In response, we refresh Citizens @ the Centre, to make modern and simple digital channels available for people who use them, and to streamline non-digital channels and reserve them for those who need them.
