title: What is Citizens @ the Centre?
---
--------------------------------------------------------------
Simply put, Citizen @ the Centre is a vision for how the public service sees itself making the citizen experience better. It conveys that the BC Government is open to working and delivering services in new ways. It is intended to provide the BC Public Service with clarity on who is doing what, and to share the stories innovative approaches that are taking place around government so that we can connect. Finally the accompanying toolkit is intended to offer resources and connect Public Service staff that can help to make the vision outlined in Citizens @ the Centre real.
